# Smokex.Umbrella

## Why?

* Not everybody has CI pipelines
* You don't want to mix CI executions with smoke testing
* You want a clear way to identify downtimes, errors...
* Monitor any legacy project with little effort
* But also easily run smoke tests on a new project to validate deployments
* Can give access to third parties without to have access to source code o
    sensitive tools
* Won't require technical knowledge
* Won't be coupled to any testing library and making changes transparent to the
    repo
